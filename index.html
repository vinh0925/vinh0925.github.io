    <h2>Projects: </h2>
    <h3>Overseer</h3>
    <p>This is a chrome extension that tracks how much time you spend on every website you visit.
         It displays a top 10 list of websites sorted in how much time spent on each website. There
         is also a graph to help visualize this data using chart.js.
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>The extension tracks time by getting the using a date object to get the current time. It does 
        this every time the user visits a new page and changes tabs so that every time the user is viewing
        a different page, the extension gets the time again and stores the difference from the previous get.
        The times and stores as values in a hashtable with the keys being the urls.
    </p>
    <h3>PrettyYTComments</h3>
    <p>This is a chrome extension that adds the font. "Gaegu" to all Youtube Comments. Additionally, 
        the color of the comments can be changed using a color picker in the popup box. The color that
        is chosen is saved.
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>The extension loads the style changes from a content script. To remember the color changes, a new 
        content script must be loaded with JavaScript in order to use stored variables. The color picker is from
        jscolor.js
    </p>
    <h3>GetHip</h3>
    <p>This is a chrome extension that uses quickly searches a word on UrbanDictionary. The definition of the word appears
        in a small window in the top left corner of the screen when searching a word through highlighting and clicking from
        the context menu. Words can also be searched through the omnibox using the key word "hip".
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>Uses chrome api and variables to open new tabs or windows with a url that matches if a user were to search the
        word manually.
    </p>
    <h3>Song Poll Visualizer</h3>
    <p>
        This is a Java application that reads in polling data from a text file and stores this polling data into a 
        linked list. This polling data can be visualized from a GUI showcasing what type of people like a song. These
        "types" of people are classified by 1 of 4 hobbies, locations, or majors depending on which option you would like
        to visualize.
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>
        Data is stored and sorted in a linked list. The sorting is handled with insertion sort and compares different values
        depending on what type of people the GUI is representing.
    </p>

    <h3>Handwritten Number Reader</h3>
    <p>This is a MATLAB application that analyzes the pixel colors in a small grid and predicts what number, 0 through 9,
         that is written. The program is an assignment from the online Standford's Machine Learning course. Skeleton
         code was also supplied by them.
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>
        Feedforward propagation was used to predict the numbers from parameters and the backpropagation was used to
        calculate the parameters. Together, the program slowly learns how to predict the numbers from the handwriting.
